FreeSpeech
----------

The idea here is to encode arbitrary data as human words taken from an arbitrary wordlist of arbitrary length.
Then, using the same wordlist, be able to decode the words back to the same data as before.

I will expand on the concept and techniques used later, for now, a working reference implementation can be found in
freespeech.py.  A sample wordlist can be found in english.txt.
